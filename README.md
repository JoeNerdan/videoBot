# videoBot
A shellscript to take 16:9 videos and cut a 9:16 piece out of the middle for youtube-short style videos
It also puts locally generated subtitles under the videos

It tries to preserve all quality when run normally, when run with -preview you can check out the subtitle placement and the crop of the portrait video.
